When a publicly dialable address is detected, use the p2p-forge service at
<https://registration.libp2p.direct> to acquire a valid Let's Encrypt-backed
TLS certificate, which the node can then use with the relevant transports.

The node must be configured with a listener for at least one of the following
transports:

- TCP or WS or WSS, (along with the Yamux multiplexer and TLS or Noise encryption)
- QUIC-v1
- WebTransport

It also requires the Identify protocol.

## Example - Use UPnP to hole punch and auto-upgrade to Secure WebSockets

```TypeScript
import { noise } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-noise'
import { yamux } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-yamux'
import { autoTLS } from '@ipshipyard/libp2p-auto-tls'
import { autoNAT } from '@libp2p/autonat'
import { identify } from '@libp2p/identify'
import { keychain } from '@libp2p/keychain'
import { webSockets } from '@libp2p/websockets'
import { uPnPNAT } from '@libp2p/upnp-nat'
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  addresses: {
    listen: [
      '/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0/ws'
    ]
  },
  transports: [
    webSockets()
  ],
  connectionEncrypters: [
    noise()
  ],
  streamMuxers: [
    yamux()
  ],
  services: {
    autoNAT: autoNAT(),
    autoTLS: autoTLS(),
    identify: identify(),
    keychain: keychain(),
    upnp: uPnPNAT()
  }
})

// ...time passes

console.info(node.getMultiaddrs())
// includes public WSS address:
// [ '/ip4/123.123.123.123/tcp/12345/tls/ws' ]
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i @ipshipyard/libp2p-auto-tls
