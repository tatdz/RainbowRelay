http implements the WHATWG [Fetch
api](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org). It can be used as a drop in replacement
for the browser's fetch function. It supports http, https, and multiaddr
URIs. Use HTTP in p2p networks.

## Example

See the `examples/` for full examples of how to use the HTTP service.

```typescript
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { http } from '@libp2p/http-fetch'

const node = await createLibp2p({
    // other options ...
    services: {
      http: http()
    }
})

await node.start()

// Make an http request to a libp2p peer
let resp = await node.services.http.fetch('multiaddr:/dns4/localhost/tcp/1234')

// Or a traditional HTTP request
resp = await node.services.http.fetch('multiaddr:/dns4/example.com/tcp/443/tls/http')

// And of course, you can use the fetch API as you normally would
resp = await node.services.http.fetch('https://example.com')

// This gives you the accessibility of the fetch API with the flexibility of
// using a p2p network.
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/http-fetch
```

## Browser `<script>` tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make its exports available as `Libp2pHttpFetch` in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@libp2p/http-fetch/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```
